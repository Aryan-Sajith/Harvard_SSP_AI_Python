This repository will contain the code from the [Harvard Summer School Program Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/summer/ai/2021/#optimization) course.

## Projects
  - [Search](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Search):
    - [Degrees](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Search/degrees): A project regarding the "Degrees of Separation" that helps connect any two actors according to IMDB data.
    - [TicTacToe](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Search/tictactoe): A project that graphically emulates and builds an AI that makes optimal moves to against human users.
  - [Knowledge](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Knowledge):
    - [Knights](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Knowledge/knights): A project based on the Knights and Knaves puzzles that simulates logical problem solving and knowledge representation in python programming.
    - [Minesweeper](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Knowledge/minesweeper): A project based on the popular Minesweeper game that allows either human players or an AI to make moves to solve a Minesweeper puzzle.
  - [Uncertainty](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Uncertainty/pagerank)(Only one project for this  topic):
    - [Pagerank](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Uncertainty/pagerank): A project that works to rank web page documents(HTML files) based on connectivity and relevance within a corpus of webpage connectivity.
  - [Optimization](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Optimization/crossword)(Only one project for this topic):
    - [Crosswords](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Optimization/crossword): A project that builds crossword puzzles and utilizes optimization heuristics and algorithms to pick words from a vocabulary list to fill out certain crossword puzzles.
  - [Learning](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Learning):
    - [Shopping](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Learning/shopping): A project that builds an AI to predict whether a customer will either make a purchase or not on a shopping website. This will be achieved by utilizing a nearest neighbor classifier and making predictions that build upong true-negative/positive rates.
    - [Nim](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Learning/nim): A project that builds an AI to learn from evidence provided regarding the game of Nim where people are provided with random objects in random rows and must work to remove objects from certain piles while taking turns. The last person to remove an object will lose. Thus, the AI plays against itself and learns from many experiences to build skills over time.
  - [Neural Networks](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/tree/main/Neural%20Networks/traffic):
    - [Traffic](https://github.com/Aryan-Sajith/Harvard_SSP_AI_Python/blob/main/Neural%20Networks/traffic/traffic.py): A project that builds and trains a convolutional neural network with images of traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs. This AI works to recognize images of road signs and categorize them based on the 43 different aforementioned categories. Overall, this AI works quite well and fluctuates between 97-98% accuracy after training about 10 times on portions of the dataset.
